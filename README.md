## About The Unsupervised Learning Workshop
With the help of engaging practical activities, [The Unsupervised Learning Workshop](https://www.amazon.com/Unsupervised-Learning-Workshop-unsupervised-unorganized/dp/1800200706/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1611062803&sr=1-1&utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781801070515&utm_term=Unsupervised%20Learning&utm_content=The%20Unsupervised%20Learning%20Workshop) teaches you how to apply unsupervised machine learning algorithms on enormous, cluttered datasets. Youâ€™ll learn the best techniques and approaches and work on real-time datasets with this hands-on guide for beginners.

## What you will learn
* Distinguish between hierarchical clustering and the k-means algorithm
* Understand the process of finding clusters in data
* Grasp interesting techniques to reduce the size of data 
* Use autoencoders to decode data
* Extract text from a large collection of documents using topic modeling
* Create a bag-of-words model using the CountVectorizer
